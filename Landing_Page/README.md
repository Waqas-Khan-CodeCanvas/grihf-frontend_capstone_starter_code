# Medical Appointment Booking Website

## Project Overview

This project is part of a digital initiative by **StayeHealthy**, a non-profit organization focused on improving healthcare accessibility in remote areas with minimal or no medical resources. The goal is to create a user-friendly web-based platform that helps patients book consultations with doctors and specialists, manage health records, and access essential healthcare services â€” anytime, anywhere.

## Problem Statement

Surveys have revealed that patients in remote areas often struggle to find the right doctor at the right time. Long wait times and a shortage of nearby medical facilities frequently lead to emergencies. This application aims to reduce that gap by enabling quick access to general practitioners and specialists through a centralized booking and consultation system.
